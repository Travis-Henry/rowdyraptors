## Introduction

An interactive true false game about dinosaurs

## Components

### 1. Leaderboard Site

The `leaderboard` folder contains the files for the leaderboard static site. This site displays all the scores from the kintone backend. The site is made using react and it is deployed on render.com

### 2. Kintone-ESP8266

The `kintone-esp8266` folder contains microcontroller code written for ESP8266 devices. This code interacts with an API, specifically designed for interfacing with Kintone, a cloud-based database management platform. Explain the purpose and functionality of this microcontroller code.

## Setup Instructions

Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and running both components of the project.

### Leaderboard Site Setup

1. Navigate to the `leaderboard` folder.
2. [Add setup instructions for the leaderboard site here.]

### Kintone-ESP8266 Setup

1. Navigate to the `kintone-esp8266` folder.
2. [Add setup instructions for the microcontroller code here.]

## Usage
