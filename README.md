## Introduction

Briefly introduce the purpose and goals of your project. Provide any necessary context or background information.

## Components

### 1. Leaderboard Site

The `leaderboard` folder contains the files for the leaderboard site. This site displays and manages a leaderboard for a specific purpose. Provide a brief description of its features and functionality.

### 2. Kintone-ESP8266

The `kintone-esp8266` folder contains microcontroller code written for ESP8266 devices. This code interacts with an API, specifically designed for interfacing with Kintone, a cloud-based database management platform. Explain the purpose and functionality of this microcontroller code.

## Setup Instructions

Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and running both components of the project.

### Leaderboard Site Setup

1. Navigate to the `leaderboard` folder.
2. [Add setup instructions for the leaderboard site here.]

### Kintone-ESP8266 Setup

1. Navigate to the `kintone-esp8266` folder.
2. [Add setup instructions for the microcontroller code here.]

## Usage

Explain how to use both components of the project. Provide examples or screenshots if applicable.

## Contributing
